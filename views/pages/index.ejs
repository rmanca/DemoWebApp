        Hello, I'm a software engineer recently graduated from <strong>MIT</strong> (course 6-3) and currently working at <strong>HubSpot</strong> in Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a Moscow-born, Miami-raised developer. I enjoy all things backend (Java, Python); however, after recently launching myself into the React.js world, I may have to revise that statement. When not tinkering with web apps, I enjoy skiing, sailing, Taekwondo, and attempting to grow a small forest in my living room.</p>

        I'm currently working at HubSpot, a marketing software company (think- everything you need to get the word out about your product via the internet) and I love it! I'm open to chatting about job opportunities (in our very own beer garden) if you'd like to love your job too.
